# Random Password Generator using Python

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a beginner-level command-line random password generator using Python. 
The application generates secure and random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as password length and character types. 
This project helps in understanding randomization, input validation, and logical programming.

## Steps Performed
1. Installed Python and set up the development environment.
2. Created a Python script to generate random passwords.
3. Defined different character sets such as:
   - Letters (uppercase and lowercase)
   - Numbers
   - Symbols
4. Took user input for password length.
5. Added input validation to ensure correct and positive values.
6. Allowed users to select the type of characters to include in the password.
7. Used the random module to generate secure and random passwords.
8. Displayed the generated password to the user.
9. Tested the program with different combinations to verify correctness.
